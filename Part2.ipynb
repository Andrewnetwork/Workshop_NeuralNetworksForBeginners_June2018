    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the process of using a neural network to produce a predictive model of the titanic dataset hosted on kaggle. There are many steps in this process that must not be overlooked or it will be more difficult to optimize the performance of your network. In particular, taking time to do EDA, feature engineering, and be considerate when preprocessing the data will stave of many potential modeling headaches later on. It is our aim to make you comfortable with the basics of each of these stages, so you can effectively use neural networks on your data. \n",

    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n",

    "**Key Challenges of Using a Neural Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of parameters a statistical model has determines the range of functions it can represent. We call this range the *capacity* of a model. Models with greater capacity have a tendency to overfit the training data. Neural Networks are the epitome of high-capacity models. High-capacity models generally don't do well on small datasets. Large datasets balance out a neural network's tendency to overfit. With small datasets, we must pay great attention to how we regularize the network in order to fight this overfitting behavior. While there are many ways of doing this, in this notebook we will be using the dropout method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic data is a very small dataset of about 800 or so samples. This means our success is dependent upon proper regularization of the network. Lower capacity models like random forests or svms would do much better out of the box because they will not overfit as reaidly; however, if we tune the network well, we can generally beat their performance. \n",
